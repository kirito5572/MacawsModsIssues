3.0.0
Update Warning: Important Information
We're thrilled to introduce the latest 3.0.0 update, which includes significant optimizations.
If you are updating from an older version to this one and have already placed bridges or stairs, please note that they will look weird due to changes in the update. To resolve this issue, you'll need to perform a block update on affected bridges or stairs. Here's how:
Place any block above/next to the affected bridge or stairs, or break and replace the affected bridge or stairs, which will trigger an update for neighboring bridges.
We highly recommend creating backups of your existing game worlds before applying this update.

 
Changelog:

Performance:
- Made many changes, to reduce the memory usage as much as I
could, lowered memory usage by 80-90%.
- Refactored code to be more efficient and optimized
- Lowered the count of all blockstates by 85 - 89 %
( From 13920 to 1516 )
- Removed lots of model.jsons and made them more efficient

Added :
- Stone Bridges, Stairs, Piers have new variations
( nether bricks, mossy cobblestone, cobblestone, end stone bricks,
prismarine bricks, andesite, granite, diorite )
- New Balustrade Stone Bridges ( 17 variations )
- Red Asian Bridge, Support, Stairs
- Glass Bridge, Support, Stairs

Bridge Torch & Lantern:
- Can be placed on bridge/bridge stairs railings ( They have a tooltip )
- Cannot be placed in the middle
- They break if there is no solid block below them

Bridge Piers:
- Can now be waterlogged (again!..)
- Have a new model

Changes:
- Most bridges have an improved model
- All Bridges have now the same height (base/railings), this change fixes the no step sounds whilst walking on a bridge
- Removed Torches in bridges, made separate torches which can be placed on bridge/bridge stair railing ( to prevent doubling the states because of this..)
- Rope Bridges have only 2 facing sides, north and east. Since west and south would be the same as north and east, we decided to merge it so it wont create redundant blockstates
- Bridge handrails/handguards have been reworked, you can now toggle between all 4 sides or empty platform, with this change you can modify bridges like never before
- Bridges have an updated placing mechanism, if you place a bridge while on a bridge, it will place down a bridge in the way you are facing ( Similar to the scaffolding )
- Bridge Stairs have also an updated placing mechanism, if you place the stair on the stair, it will build another stair one block behind and above it, this way you can easily build bridge stairs upwards.
- Shears can be used like pliers
- Bridges now have a tooltip about Pliers/Shears
- Bridges and Stairs cannot be placed directly above themselves, this makes it easier to build
- Bridge Piers/Supports no longer connect but they have an improved model to make them look just as good as before
- All Stone recipes can now be crafted in the stonecutter too
- Bridges now have the tag Trapdoors, this is because entities are pathfinding it when it has the tag...
